# Study Project on the Formation of "Umami" Taste in Foods

This project aims to study the formation of the "umami" taste in food. The "umami" taste is dependent on free amino acids and food additives, and the project uses a dataset found on Kaggle called "Umami (savoriness) in food". This dataset contains 20 free amino acids and 2 food additives.

The project was implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library for machine and deep learning. However, the Kaggle dataset has several issues, such as the lack of many values, especially for the two food additives that are presumably directly affecting the value of glutamate, which we will now assume as the indicator of the umami taste.
Usage
